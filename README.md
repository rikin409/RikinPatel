# Rikin Patel

## Hello! My name is Rikin and I currently work in eccomerce. I am hoping to transition into working in Fintech or Tech. I am hoping I can pair my Finance undergrad with some coding skills I pick up along the way to help me move into a quantative analyst role. The reason I enjoy Fintech is because I think it brings togtehr three subjects i really enjoy, which are Finance, Math, and Coding. I love how innovative and adaptive to change this industry is, as it is changing everyday and is the future of the Finance industry.
