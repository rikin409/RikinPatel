## About Myself

Hi! I am a young professional working in the eccomerce space. I am looking to navigate my way into the FinTech industry using my Finance undergrad background and my newly minted tech skills. I have picked up many coding languages such as Python, C++, and html, and I believe I am ready to dive into the rapidly evolving industry that we call Fintech. This indusrty has always stood out to me because it combines many of my interests including finance, technology, and math. To me, the most interesting part about this industry is the fact that it is so new so it is evolving rapidly as we speak. I believe that fintech will disrupt traditional finance in a big way in the next 10 years, and I hope to be on the forefront of that change. This has inspired me to take part in Columbia University's Fintech Coding Bootcamp. Some of my other interests include fitness, sports, and star wars.
